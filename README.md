🌍 Air Quality Index Prediction Using Random Forest

This project uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) based on concentrations of key air pollutants: Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O₃), PM2.5, and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂). 
The dataset is sourced from a global air pollution database containing real-world measurements collected from cities worldwide.

🌱 Motivation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  As the atmosphere continues to deteriorate over time due to urban pollution, I wanted to build a tool that could help identify key pollutants contributing to this decline. By analyzing the factors that heavily influence AQI, this project      aims to spotlight the most harmful contributors to air quality in an attempt to raise awareness of their impact.

  🔧 Feature Importance Bar Plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
      This graph shows how much each pollutant contributes to predicting the AQI. A higher importance score indicates that the feature has more influence on the model’s predictions. Example: If PM2.5 has the highest bar, it's the most significant pollutant affecting AQI.

      The residuals (difference between actual and predicted AQI) are plotted to visualize the model's error distribution. A histogram centered around zero with a narrow spread indicates accurate predictions with low bias.

    This heatmap displays the pairwise correlations between all numerical features. Strong correlations (positive or negative) help understand relationships between pollutants and AQI. For instance, a high positive correlation between PM2.5 and AQI suggests PM2.5 levels greatly impact overall air quality.
